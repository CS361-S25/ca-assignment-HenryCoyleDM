I experimented with having 2 channels per cell, one to control how blue the cell is, and one to control how yellow it is. The update function takes the blue and yellow values of the current cell and all 8 of its neighbors and returns a new blue and yellow value. Since I couldn't find good examples online of 2-variable continuous cellular automata, I decided to invent my own by randomly writing an update function and tweaking it until it had some order. The result was a pattern that creates regions with well-defined regions of yellow and blue, seperated by chaos. The stripes typically oscilate in color every 2 generations, so to make it easier to see them, I made the simulation run 2 generations per frame.
